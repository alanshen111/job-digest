# Job Digest

Job Digest is a browser extension that extracts software engineering related keywords from selected text.

The words are sorted by **"Languages"**, **"Frameworks"**, **"Technologies"**, and **"Concepts"**. Useful for quickly identifying the ATS or expected keywords for resume tailoring.

Available on all browser-unprotected websites, such as Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and more.
