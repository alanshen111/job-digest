# Job Digest

Job Digest is a Firefox extension that scans and compiles software engineering related keywords from selected text. The words are sorted by "Languages", "Frameworks", "Technologies", and "Concepts". Useful for resume tailoring. 

Like an "ATS", but for job postings!

There may still be false detections due to unusual capitalizations or spellings. The list of keywords was written manually by myself, so there may be missing technologies as well.

Feel free to submit any questions or issues.
