Description
As a RTL Engineer, you will own or participate in the following:

• Microarchitecture development and specification - from early high-level architectural exploration through micro architectural research and arriving at a detailed specification
• RTL feature ownership – development, assessment and refinement of new RTL features to target power, performance, area and timing goals
• Validation - support test bench development and simulation for functional and performance verification Performance exploration and correlation - explore high performance strategies and validate that the RTL design meets targeted performance
• Design delivery - work with multifunctional engineering team to implement and validate physical design on the aspects of timing, area, reliability, testability, and power

Minimum Qualifications

    Minimum BS and 10+ years of relevant industry experience
    Experience with Verilog and/or VHDL
    Experience with simulators and waveform debugging tools
    Experience with logic design principles

Preferred Qualifications
