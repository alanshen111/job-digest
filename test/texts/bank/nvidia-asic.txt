What you'll be doing:

    In this position, you will be responsible for verification of high-speed coherent interconnect design, architecture and golden models.

    You will be responsible for micro-architecture using sophisticated verification methodologies.

    As a member of our verification team, you'll understand the design & implementation, define the verification scope, develop the verification infrastructure (Testbenches, BFMs, Checkers, Monitors), complete test/coverage plans, and verify the correctness of the design. This role will collaborate with architects, designers, emulation, and silicon verification teams to accomplish your tasks.

What we need to see:

    Bachelors or Masterâ€™s Degree (or equivalent experience)

    3+ years of relevant verification experience.

    Experience in architecting test bench environments for unit level verification.

    Background in verification using random stimulus along with functional coverage and assertion-based verification methodologies.

    Prior Design or Verification experience of Coherent high-speed interconnects.

    Knowledge of industry standard interconnect protocols like PCIE, CXL, CHI will be useful.

    Strong background developing TB's from scratch using SV and UVM methodology is desired.

    C++ programming language experience, scripting ability and an expertise in System Verilog.

    Exposure to design and verification tools (VCS or equivalent simulation tools, debug tools like Debussy, GDB).

    Strong debugging and analytical skills.

    Experienced communication and interpersonal skills are required. A history of mentoring junior engineers and interns a huge plus.
