What you'll be doing:

    You will architect highly automated and customizable design flows using modern software engineering methodologies

    Build flows for methodologies incorporating logic/physical synthesis, design planning, equivalence checking for industry-leading chip designs

    Be responsible for design, implementation and testing in-house of CAD programs

    Work with design teams and leading EDA vendors to evaluate the industry's most powerful design implementation and analysis tools

    Provide support for ASIC tools and flows

    Assist chip design teams with advanced implementation tasks

What we need to see:

    BS in Electrical, Computer Engineering or equivalent experience with 3+ years of CAD experience; MS preferred

    Be familiar with Verilog and ASIC design along with experience in commercial EDA tools

    Software engineering experience with software design, algorithms, data structures, testing

    Have a strong proficiency in at least one of Python, Perl, Tcl, C/C++

    Knowledge or experience with logic synthesis, physical design, formal equivalence checking.

    Proven track record developing flows and/or tools for chip design

Ways to stand out from the crowd:

    Familiarity with Machine Learning/Deep Learning

    Experience in other ASIC methodologies such as RTL Lint, CDC, DFT or STA.

    Experience with compute farm interaction: software deployment, performance optimization, containers, etc.
