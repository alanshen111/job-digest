What you'll do

We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017  — since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the developer platform market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support. Workers has allowed Cloudflare to add programmability to the edge such that developers could have access to writing logic on the edge in their preferred way — through code. Over the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a fully blown full-stack platform. With any application, however, in addition to serverless compute, you need to be able to manage state. In 2022, Cloudflare released D1 — built on Durable Objects, D1 is Cloudflare’s first serverless database.  In this role, you’ll be helping define and building the future of D1 to enable developers to build full stack applications.
