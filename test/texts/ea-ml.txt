Your Responsibilities

    Apply best ML techniques in context to develop the best models that generate high quality human motions which respond quickly to user pad inputs in game.
    Integrate these models into C++ game code to implement or support shipping features
    Develop and maintain a complete animation data pipeline for ML training from source to deployment.
    Develop stress tests to fully test any deployed models.
    Gather and analyze cases in deployment and come up with ways to optimize model performance.
    Gather, annotate, or synthesize the required data for your models, based on EA FCâ€™s extensive mocap and real-world volumetric data as well as feedback from our animation experts
    Share your results through shipping product features, presentations, papers, prototypes and compelling interactive demonstrations
    Stay abreast of the latest advancements and consult with internal stakeholders such as production, design, and artists, to identify opportunities and propose impactful projects
